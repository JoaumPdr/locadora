This is a simple Java project with a database. Its goal is to simulate a rental system. The database I used was My SQL and its plugin to connect to the Java project.

Some of the features proposed by the project are a CRUD menu of customers, rentals, and items (such as games and movies) to be rented.

Note: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
